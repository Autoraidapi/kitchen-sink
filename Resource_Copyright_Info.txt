resources / 13_ThatsGood.mp3

	Downloaded from http://ccmixter.org/files/DoKashiteru/17756

	by	DoKashiteru featuring	archive.org, nasa.gov

	So, I’ve gotten a ton, of, mileage out of a little sample pack that indieish.com made from archive.org here ... I figured, hey! Why not do the same? 

	So, enter DoKashiteru’s public service for electronic musicians: themed sample packs! This is (a) fun to do, (b) incredibly useful, and (c) all public-domain, so it’s free to use.

	And this is part 1 of the series: a Sci-Fi themed sample pack. Robots, space, NASA, you name it! All either vintage (nice and crackly recordings) or modern (nice and crisp NASA recordings!

	Share and Enjoy!
